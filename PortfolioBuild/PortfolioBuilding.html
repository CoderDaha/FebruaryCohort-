            <h2>Why did you start learning to code?</h2>
            <p>My interest in code came after i graduated from university last year. I recieved a 2:1 Upper Class division in Civil Engineering but was quite unsure if i wanted to work as a Civil Engineer for the rest of my life. I wanted a job where i can be flexible from working in the office,at home and even abroad.I first saw a few videos on coding and have been loving the problem solving aspects, although it can be frustrading if the code doesnt run,but finding the small mistakes can be quite satisfying.</p>
